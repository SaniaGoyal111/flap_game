# flap_game
This project is a simple implementation of the popular Flappy Bird game using the Pygame library in Python. It involves controlling a bird to navigate through gaps between obstacles while avoiding collisions.

Features
Smooth Gameplay: The bird moves up when the spacebar is pressed and falls due to gravity otherwise.
Randomized Obstacles: The height of the obstacles is randomized to create dynamic gameplay.
Collision Detection: The game ends when the bird collides with an obstacle or the ground.
Score Tracking: Tracks the player's score based on the number of obstacles successfully passed.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Pygame library (pip install pygame)

Gameplay Instructions
Use the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and move upwards.
Avoid colliding with the obstacles and the ground.
The score increases as you pass through the gaps between obstacles.
Code Overview
Bird Movement: Controlled via keypresses, with upward and downward movement.
Obstacle Generation: Randomized heights for dynamic gameplay.
Collision Detection: Ends the game when a collision is detected.
Score Display: Displays the score on the screen during gameplay.
